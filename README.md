## ABOUT

This project is part of the Front End Nanodegree program from Udacity. The objective is to take the starter code from the Udacity repository and make it responsive, accesible and offline accessible.

### INSTALLATION

This project requires Git, Python and an ES6 capable web browser.

1. Clone the project by using `$ git clone https://github.com/borason/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git` in your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project.
3. Start up the HTTP server. If you don't know how to do that, the [Udacity Starter Repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) has detailed instructions that I will include below.

>In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

The main objective of this project is to test the offline capability of this website. If you are using chrome you can test this by opening the console panel. Navigate to the Application pane. Next, click on the Service Worker option. Click on the checkbox options for Offline and Update On Reload. Now reload the page.
